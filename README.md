Simple chat app built with Node, Express, and plain JavaScript, using WebSocket API.

To do:
~~num of users should decrease if someone closes ws connection~~
- able to private message other users
- show when users are typing; should say username is typing, and disappear when no longer typing
~~on new connection show new user all the old messages in chatroom~~
